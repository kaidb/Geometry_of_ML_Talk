# Geometry_of_ML_Talk
## Author: Kai Bernardini, kaidb [AT] [DOT] bu [DOT] edu
- Lecture slides written in jupyter notebook for a talk I gave about the geometry of Machine Learning.
- Based on a talk I gave at  [Lookout](https://www.lookout.com/) during their Security Bootcamp. 


# Slides are made using [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE)


 To setup reqs, execute `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install all requirements

# If you spot a mistake, please open an issue. 


# Try it out in [Bindr](https://mybinder.org/)
- Note that using [h2o](https://www.h2o.ai/) will not work in bindr, as java is not installed by default.
